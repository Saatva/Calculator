It must also be able to clear the display and start a new equation.
The calculator must also apply the look provided in the CSS doc.
If used correctly the item should look something akin to the screenshot included.
(fluid widths will cause it to look wide on larger screens)

The basic Calculator constructor is already provided with an init method.  Complete the object.

Styles to be used to style the calculator when building your application.

Do not directly add html to this file, only Javascript.
Any HTML elements you will need should be created and manipulated via scripts.
