# Calculator
Calculator test app.

Calculator Test
Purpose: To demonstrate a deeper understanding of Javascript and HTML.

Parameters:
Without using Jquery or any other library, create a calculator that can do complex operations.
The calculator must have an operations window that shows the current total for the operation being performed.
The calculator must perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents.
It must also be able to clear the display and start a new equation using both the clear method and inputting a number
after the equals function is fired.
If an operation button is pressed the total must be used to continue to the equation.
The calculator must also apply the look provided in the CSS doc.
If used correctly the item should look something akin to the screenshot included.
(fluid widths will cause it to look wide on larger screens)

The basic Calculator constructor is already provided with an init method.  Complete the object.

Materials Provided:

calculator.css:

Styles to be used to style the calculator when building your application.
You can add additional styles but you will need to demonstrate the ability to add classes and
ids through DOM manipulation.
Use is mandatory.

index.html:

Index file that will initiate the Calculator application.
Do not directly add html to this file, only Javascript.
Any HTML elements you will need should be created and manipulated via scripts.

calculator.js:

The JS file with the boilerplate Calculator constructor.  This is where 99% of your code should live.

Bonus:

	•	Have previous calculations stored in local storage and have them populate div onscreen when page loads.

	•	Use icomoon font for mathematic symbols.
